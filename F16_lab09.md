##Issues For the Next Generation 

* Issue 1: GUI button for picture explanation.
           Very similar to how the welcome Window Has a button that displays a pictorial explanation, add one to the main GUI.
           (estimates 50 points);

* Issue 2: Create tests for RSA Cipher
          There is no test class for the RSA Cipher. Include a sufficient amount of tests for this cipher.
          (estimates 100 points);

* Issue 3: Make GUI resizable
           The length and width of all the swing component classes are hard coded in the main GUI. Refactor code so that the window is scalable       (estimates 250 points);

* Issue 4: Fix RSA Cipher algorithm
          Currently the algorithm isn't working. The majority of the algorithm is there, however, it does not work correctly. The cipher is based off of the algorithm that is described in the page linked below:
RSA (algorithm)     (estimate 150 points);
