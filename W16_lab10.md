#lab 10, David Du



* Issue: Given an already existing text file with plaintext, key, and encrypted strings, implement a feature to read in the data from the file and use them to decrypt or encrypt. [Read in from input file](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-utilities-cryptography/issues/27) (150)

* Issue: Add to interface so that the user can control where the output file is saved and what it is called. [Control output](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-utilities-cryptography/issues/28) (200)
