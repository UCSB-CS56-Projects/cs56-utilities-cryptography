===========================

Proposal
===============


Implementation of 3 different types of ciphers:
	       -Shift Cipher
	       -Affine Cipher
	       -Vigenere Cipher

================
Issues to fix:

       -Add another more complicated cipher on top of the 3 that already exist
       -Include tutorials or hints on how to enter the keys and plaintext in the GUI so that users don't run into problems with data entry
       -Clean up extra ~ files that are still hanging around.
       -Make GUI look better in general
       -Include an option to decrypt whatever you just encrypted without having to reenter the encrypted plaintext in the entry field.
       -This project has been curated and pruned very well and has full javadoc comments. Most of the value in this project will be in improved clarity on the GUI and the addition of a more complicated cipher.
