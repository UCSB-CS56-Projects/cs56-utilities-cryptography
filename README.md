 YES | mastergberry | Implementation of 3 different types of string ciphers, both encryption and decryption.
```

Implementation of 3 different types of ciphers:
	       -Shift Cipher
	       -Affine Cipher
	       -Vigenere Cipher
	       -Bifid Cipher

Shift Cipher:
      Takes an integer a as the key.
      Encrypts the plaintext by shifting the characters along by adding the key to each of the characters and taking modulus 26

Affine Cipher:
       Takes 2 integers (a and b) as the key.
       Encrypts the plaintext by multiplying the character values by a and then adding b, taking modulus 26.

Vigenere Cipher:
      Takes a String s as the key.
      Encrypts the plaintext by applying the Shift Cipher to each character in the plaintext using the associated letter in the key as the key.

      e.g.
      plaintext = "random"
      key = "abc"
      
      Line up:	random
      	   	abcabc

      Giving:   rbpdpo

Bifid Cipher:
	Takes a String s as the key.
	Encrypts the plaintext by applying the Bifid Cipher to each character using a 25 letter 'key square' example of encryption using this 25 letter 'key square'

Format of Input for GUI:

General:
	No spaces are to be used in the key or plaintext input fields. Capital letters can be used but will be translated to lowercase prior to any cryptographic operation being performed on them.

Shift Cipher:
	Key text field should contain a single integer within the range of 0 to 25 inclusive.

Affine Cipher:
	Key text field should contain two integers seperated by a single space, with the first integer being with the range of 0 to 25 inclusive and the second integer being greater than 0. If decrypting, the additional condition that the first integer must not be a coprime with 26 also holds.

Vigenere Cipher:
	Key text field should contain a string of characters.
	
Bifid Cipher:
	The Plaintext can have uppercase or lowercase letters and spaces but numbers will result in an error. The key has to have at least one captial letter and no numbers. The key setter will parse out all non capital letters.

W16 final remarks:

-Most of ciphers have not been changed and have only been implemented differently.
-Now you can input more than one string with spaces in between.
-You can now use all the ciphers at once to encrypt one string.
-After each cipher, the program will write to a file called "output.txt"

The program itself takes in an input string and input key to encrypt or decrypt the input string. Each encryption cipher has already been defined and most of the work will be in the Cryptography.java file. There is a lot of opportunity to refactor some of the JButton codes.
