# First Look at Legacy Code
## Lab 03, CS56 F17

## By Kaushik Mahorker and Arielle Robles

**(a) Brief Description**
* An encryption and decryption tool using 5 different ciphers.
----
**(b) User Stories**  
* As a user, I can enter plain text into the GUI and choose between 5 different ciphers to generate a key and ciphered text, or generate all 5 at once.
* As a user, I can copy and paste the ciphered text back into the GUI and decipher it.
* As a user, I can save the ciphered text to a chosen location on my computer using the GUI.
* As a user I get a detailed explanation of each cipher under the hood so that I know how to use the tool
* As a user I can upload a file as input text to be encrypted or decrypted.
* As a user, I can open a new window for the RSA cipher.
* As a user, I can copy and clear all input in the cipher text areas through the GUI.
----

**(c) Software Functionality Assessment**
* The program runs successfully. When it runs, it opens the main GUI with a welcome window in front of it. The welcome window describes the different ciphers in plain text. The welcome window has the option to not be show again, or to show a visual diagram of a session, annotated with colorful diagrams of how to use the GUI. The GUI is ready to use upon opening, except for the RSA cipher. Four of the ciphers open in the main GUI, with the exception of the RSA cipher, which opens in a new window. The RSA cipher does not currently encrypt the plain text. From the main GUI, .txt files can be uploaded into the program to be encrypted. Encrypted text can be saved to the computer. The save and import functionalities use a GUI to choose folder destinations.
----

**(d) Potential Features**
* As a user, I wish I could click a single button and have the ciphered text and regular text switch places and switch to decrypt mode, rather than needing to copy and paste manually.
* As a user, I wish I could open all of the ciphers in a new window rather than just the RSA window and retain the functionality of the original window (i.e. input file, output file).
----

**(e) Assessment of README.md**
* The README is currently well written and new updates/changes have been recorded, enabling a new developer to know the progression of the project. The README could be updated to improve readability. There are examples for each cipher and their respective algorithms. There are also links to the HTML javadocs. I would add some links to external resources about general cryptography for reference, as well as edit and reorganize the format of the file to look more visually appealing by separating the release information from the usage information. 
----

**(f) Assessment of build.xml**  
* The build file only needs to be cleaned up in the jar and javadoc targets. We can improve the readability of the targets by defining class paths.
* There is nothing more that needs to be fixed in the build file.
----

**(g) Assessment of Current Issues**  
* There are enough issues to earn 1000 points. Some of the issues are very clear, while others are very broad or open, but in general one can understand where to start from. The issues are not all “bugs” some of them are enhancements and require more creativity than others.
----

**(h) Additional Issues (if any)**  
* None found. Things can be improved but nothing is broken besides the issues already reported.
----

**(i) Assessment of Code Quality**  
* The purpose of each class is clear. They are separated into different types of cyphers. Something we could improve would be to refactor the ciphers. Each cipher has an encrypt, decrypt, and generate key method that they implement. We could refactor the code to use inheritance. There is a KeyGenerator class that constructs an instance of KeyGenerator that seems like it might have been used as an attempt to refactor the KeyGenerator method out of the cipher classes, but it is not well documented.
* We would organize the classes into different packages, separating them by Tester classes, GUI classes, and Cipher classes.
* The code is easy to read and includes javadoc comments to explain the purpose of the methods. Some of the variable names could be more descriptive (i.e. instead of keyA, keyB, use decryptKey and encryptKey), but they get the job done.
* To help someone get up to speed on the project, we would let them know that the project is currently organized by a class for each cipher, a tester class for each cipher, a couple GUI classes as well as a static utility class. The GUI classes act as the view and the controller for receiving and processing actions. The cipher classes encapsulate the different encryption and decryption algorithms. The tester classes ensure that these algorithms work properly. And finally the utility class is a collection of standard methods that are used throughout multiple classes (polymorphism).
----

**(j) Assessment of Test Coverage**  
* We could implement GUI test coverage to make sure that buttons work. There are no test classes for the GUIs right now.
* Almost every class has an affiliated tester class that runs JUnit tests. The test coverage is very good for the project, but the specific test cases do not necessarily cover edge cases. To expand the test coverage I would include more corner case testing for each method to ensure the methods take care of the full range of input.
* The RSA cipher test file does not exist.
