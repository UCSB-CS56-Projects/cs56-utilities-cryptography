+ <h4>a. General Information</h4> <a id ="pa"></a>
  - Generally, this is a tool that can encrypt the string users type and generate a key.
  - In addition, it can decrypt by the key given and output the plaintext accordingly.

+ <h4>c. General Information</h4> <a id ="pc"></a>
  - The software is able to run and present the GUI to users.
  - This software provides four ways to encrypt/decrypt the plaintext with the keys the users type.
  - For convinience I guess, it also provides an `All Ciphers` option that can encrypt or decrypt four plaintexts with four keys and generate the four output respectively.
  - For instruction, users can either click `Info`  button for information of `All Ciphers` or click the button of each cipher for specific requirement of each cipher.
  - However, I cannot use the `All Ciphers` in encryption.   
  
+ <h4>d. General Information</h4> <a id ="pd"></a>
+ <h4>e. About the README</h4> <a id ="pe"></a>
  - The README.md file has the sample output and input using two ciphers, but it would be
   better if it also has examples for the other two ciphers and the `All Ciphers`.
  - For the remark of W16, there should also have examples of "input more than one string 
   with spaces in between" and "use all the ciphers at once to encrypt one string," so that
   the next generation of folks can follows much more easily.
