##Issues For the Next Generation 



* Issue 1: Be able to read the output file generated from Encryption and decrypt it. 
           Then, generate another file that records the result of decryption. 
           Allow user to name the file and decide where to save it. (estimate 200 points)

* Issue 2: Make more specific error message. For example, if the user types letters on the
           key of a cipher which can only take integer key, the program may prompt "the cipher 
           cannot take integer as keys, use letters instead." (estimates 100 points);
