##Issues For the Next Generation 



* Issue 1: Be able to read the output file generated from Encryption and decrypt it. 
           Then, generate another file that records the result of decryption. 
           Allow user to name the file and decide where to save it. (estimate 200 points)

* Issue 2: Make more specific error message. For example, if the user types letters for the
           key of a cipher which can only take integer key, the program may prompt "the cipher 
           cannot take integer as keys, use letters instead." (estimates 100 points);

* Issue 3: Make a new welcome page for the application. For example, when the user opens the app
           for the first time, he/she will be prompted with this new window "welcome" and 
           in this window, there are several pages. For example the first page is an introduction
           about the app, and second page would be example of how to use shift cipher, the next 
           page would be how to use affine cipher, and so on... Make sure that this welcome page
           has a checkbox that says "open me everytime the app starts". If deselected, the welcome
           page will not appear on the next startup. (estimates 150 points);

* Issue 4: Add "open" button that gives a window that let you choose whatever address you want 
           to save your text file, instead of having you type the address out in "save address". 
           Like those windows that you have when you are trying to upload files to your browser. 
           Also add "folder" button that brings up the save location folder so that user can access
           it directly in the OS. (estimates 150 points);
