### Issues
* Refactor Cipher Classes #70 : Cipher classes perform a similar function and should use a super class and implement inheritance to factor out the common code between ciphers. Rewrite existing ciphers to extend Cipher super class. (https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-utilities-cryptography/issues/70)
* Mismatching Error Dialog Boxes #71 : When errors occur, the wrong labels and information about the error are shown. (i.e. Error with RSA has Dialog box title: Affine Cipher, Error with Key for RSA says the text input has an error) (https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-utilities-cryptography/issues/71)
* Clean Button doesn't clear RSA #72 : The clean button removes the keys from all the text fields except for the RSA. Clear the RSA key text field when the clean button is pressed. (https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-utilities-cryptography/issues/72)
* Add ability to switch to encrypt mode from dialog box #73 : If you are in decrypt mode and try to generate a key, an error shows up that you must be in encrypt mode. Include a button on the dialog box, that says "Switch to Encrypt Mode", that will directly change the mode for you. (https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-utilities-cryptography/issues/73)
* Confusing Stack Trace Error #74 : Stack trace is printed for a case where an error dialog box is shown. This is confusing for the developers who expect a stack trace when a run-time error occurs, rather than when a dialog box prevents the user from taking this "dangerous" action. Reproduce error by switching to decrypt mode and attempting to keyGen.
